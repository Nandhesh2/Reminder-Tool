# 🧠 Reminder Tool  
Ever found yourself deep in a rabbit hole of memes, videos, or random scrolling when you were supposed to be doing homework? Same. That’s why I built this little tool—to keep me (and maybe you) on track.

## ✨ What Is It?

A lightweight Python program that displays a custom reminder on your screen—always on top, so you can't ignore it while procrastinating.  
Currently built for **Windows**.

- **Fully Customizable**:  
  Change the text, colors, size, and position to match your vibe.

  Right-click for options, triple-click to move the reminder around.
